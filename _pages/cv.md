## Work Experience

<ins>November 2020 - Present: Research Assistant</ins>
:   *[Middle East Technical University](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/onur-selim-kilic)*
:   Worked as a research assistant in the METU Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Helped students while they are conducting experiments or gathering and analyzing data in the context of their lectures. Attended exams as proctor, read and graded reports and quizzes.

<ins>June 2020 - Present: Scientific Project Specialist</ins>
:   *[METU Center for Image Analysis](http://ogam.metu.edu.tr/en/)*
:   *Supervisor: Prof. Dr. A. AydÄ±n Alatan*
:   Designed and developed a cognitive real-time camera system to enhance face recognition quality in a project granted by The Republic of Turkey Presidency of Defense Industries. Face detection, object tracking, and background substraction algorithms were utilized within the project's scope using different camera models of  [HiSilicon](https://www.hisilicon.com/en/). Using C++, these embedded systems are designed to give feedback through their pipelines utilizing a multi-threaded procedure. Generated and managed testing processes and observed the success of the proposed method under various challenging scenarios.}

<ins>Summer 2019: Summer Intern</ins>
:   *HAVELSAN*
:   Proposed and developed an object detection and segmentation algorithm which was based on the algorithms [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) and [ResUNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00592) using Python.

<ins>Summer 2018: Summer Intern</ins>
:   *ESEN System Integration*
:   Designed and developed a baseline pedestrian detection algorithm using  [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/708428) together with a graphical user interface for wide-area surveillance using MATLAB.

## Teaching Experience

<ins>July 2021: Teaching Assistant </ins>
:   *[Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io) Computational Neuroscience track, Tutorial TA ([Certificate](/files/NMA_TA_Certificate.pdf))*
:   Having enjoyed being an interactive student immensely the year before, I wanted to become a TA in NMA-CN. I was responsible for a pod in NMA-CN online summer school. I helped them go over tutorials about fundamental topics on computational neuroscience and develop a project, answered their questions about the coding exercises and the underlying theory.
:   Here's a [Twitter thread on a funny incident](https://twitter.com/ogulyurdakul/status/1420058847289516035?s=20&t=EkKAiZHDh7fJ4JEoGzkDHg) I went through at the end of my TAship this year.

<ins>Fall 2018 & Spring 2020: Part-Time Student Assistant</ins>
:   *METU Department of Mathematics*
:   I was the student assistant for the course MA153 Calculus for Mathematics Students I (Fall 2018) and MA154 Calculus for Mathematics Students II (Spring 2020); and I graded weekly assignments and provided feedback to students.
